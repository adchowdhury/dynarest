# Dynamic Rest Service
This is to create dynamic rest service for spring based web applications


This is just taken out from the web application. Spring configuration is not as per implementing application. working towards Maven Module script.

This is advanced than swagger. In case of swagger we need to change the basic code base to expose a new rest service from any existing API. Where as in this case, this will be directly done without adding any code.

Currently I am using http://flexjson.sourceforge.net/ as conversion utility, but I am planing to use http://xstream.codehaus.org

Any one interested to be part of this, please come forward.

If anyone finds any issue or have any query, feel free to give feedback or reach out to me.
